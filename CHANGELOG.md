Version 0.6.0
=============

- **New features**:
  -----------------
    - Added enclosures, drives and virtualdrives to main __init__.py
    - Increased test coverage
    - [**Storcli**]         Added version properties to storcli class
    - [**Storcli**]         Added property to get the list of controllers
    - [**Controller**]      Method `create_vd` now accepts `PDperArray`. If it is required for some raid types, it is set to #disks//2. Requested in [#2](https://github.com/Naudit/pystorcli2/issues/2)
    - [**DriveMetrics**]    Added vd and vd_id properties to DriveMetrics class
    - [**Drive**]           Added method `set_state` that can be forced. Requested in [#5](https://github.com/Naudit/pystorcli2/issues/5)
    - [**Drive**]           Added class `DriveState` to better manage drive states. Closes [#7](https://github.com/Naudit/pystorcli2/issues/7)
    - [**Drives**]          Added class `Drives` to manage a list of drives. This have been just added to keep the enclosures/virtualdrives working model.

- **Fixes**:
  ----------
    - Package `pystorcli2` installs packages `pystorcli` and `pystorcli2` for backward compatibility. This is a temporary fix until all the projects using `pystorcli` are updated to use `pystorcli2`. The package `pystorcli` will be removed in the future. Contents of `pystorcli` and `pystorcli2` are the same.
    Requested in [#1](https://github.com/Naudit/pystorcli2/issues/1)
    - Fixed variable `__all__` in project `__init__.py`
    - [**Storcli**]         Fixed issue with `get_controllers` method. Requested in [#6](https://github.com/Naudit/pystorcli2/issues/6)
    - [**Storcli**]         Fixed (some) calls when storcli rejects returning jsons. Requested in [#8](https://github.com/Naudit/pystorcli2/issues/8)
    - [**Controller**]      Fixed issue with `create_vd` method. Now it is possible to create a virtual drive with a specific number of physical drives per array. Requested in [#2](https://github.com/Naudit/pystorcli2/issues/2)
    - [**Drive**]           Fixed issue with `set_state` method & property. Requested in [#5](https://github.com/Naudit/pystorcli2/issues/5)
    - [**Binaries**][**metric**]: fixed library calls
    - Other minor fixes


- **Breaking changes**
  --------------------
    - Supported python versions are now 3.8 and onwards
    - Slowly we are migrating to python3-typed classes. This have changed types in many clases and more is coming in future versions.
      If you found any issue (typing error), please report it and we'll fix it as soon as possible.
    - Migrated from setup.py to pyproject.toml
    - [**Enclosure**]        Drive list is now a *`Drives` object* instead of a *list of `Drive`* objects
